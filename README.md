## Sensor Simulation Custom Device ##

The **Sensor Simulation Custom Device** allows users to add FPGA sensor simulation functionality to their system definition file.  As the sensors supported are currently, LVDT, RVDT and Resolver, this functionality is commonly used for aerospace simulation.
 
When used, the sensor simulation custom device will inspect a user provided FPGA bitfile and find xVDT (LVDT or RVDT) and Resolver IP inside for use with NI VeriStand.
